toc::[]

In this experiment we generate PGO profile data from compiling
unmodified RPM packages and feed those profiles into a PGO optimized
rebuild of LLVM.

We create an instrumented LLVM toolchain in a Copr project called
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented].
In another Copr project called
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/profile-data-collection]
we build a modified `redhat-rpm-config` package. Every package that gets
built in that project will automatically produce a subpackage
`<PACKAGE>-clang-profdata` with PGO profile data. We demonstrate this
with a simple "Hello, World!" application that is called `myapp`. We
then collect all those subpackages through `BuildRequires:` tags in
another package called `llvm-pgo-profdata`. During the build of that
package, all profiles are merged into an indexed profile data file. The
final `llvm-pgo-profdata` RPM then installs the indexed profile data
file into a location from which a PGO optimized build of LLVM can read
it. This PGO optimized build of the LLVM toolchain is done in a third
Copr project called
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/llvm-pgo-optimized].

[[_non_goal]]
== Non-goal

It is not a goal to get a perfectly tweaked PGO optimization build of
LLVM. Instead we want to explor a way how to setup a pipeline in
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/[Copr] for further tweaking and
experimentation.

The only operating system that we build for in this experiment is Fedora
37 on x86_64.

[[_understand_what_pgo_can_do]]
== Understand what PGO can do

____
PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization) allows your compiler to better
optimize code for how it actually runs. Users report that applying this
to Clang and LLVM can decrease overall compile time by 20%.
(https://llvm.org/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.html#introduction[Source])
____

____
Profile information enables better optimization. For example, knowing
that a branch is taken very frequently helps the compiler make better
decisions when ordering basic blocks. Knowing that a function `foo` is
called more frequently than another function `bar` helps the inliner.
Optimization levels `-O2` and above are recommended for use of profile
guided optimization. […​] [Be] careful to collect profiles by running
your code with inputs that are representative of the typical behavior.
Code that is not exercised in the profile will be optimized as if it is
unimportant, and the compiler may make poor optimization choices for
code that is disproportionately used while profiling.
(https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#profile-guided-optimization[Source])
____

For the https://getfedora.org/[Fedora Linux] distribution we build a ton
of packages with LLVM. The aforementioned *inputs* are these packages
themselves. The programs to optimize are those under the LLVM umbrella
(e.g. `clang`).

The question is: How can we tap in the RPM build pipeline using
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/[Copr] and build RPM packages without
modifying their `*.spec` files manually?

I’ve created a 8 step experiment that shows how this can be achieved.
For educational purposes I’ve written many of the steps using
`Containerfile` s. This allows for a good level of isolation when you
want to build the steps on your own. To run any of the steps on your
own, you can run `make build-stepX` where
latexmath:[$X\backslash \in \left\{ {0,1,2,\ldots,7} \right\}$]. But
make sure you first read the description for each step below. Sometimes
a step really only serves a documentation purpose.

[NOTE]
====
The `Containerfile` s run as `root` to allow packages to be installed
and have a `tester` account for regular user interaction. Afterall the
resulting images are not meant for anything but demonstration purposes
and MUST NOT be used in production sites.
====

[[_how_to_follow_along]]
=== How to follow along?

I’ve been writing and testing everything on a
https://getfedora.org/[Fedora Linux] 37 laptop with `make`, `git`,
`fedpkg`, and `podman` installed.

Here’s a good starting point for preparing your system if you want to
follow along. Don’t worry we don’t install any custom RPM on your
system. Everything is build either in a podman container or on
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/[Copr].

[source,console]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y git make fedpkg podman fedora-packager krb5-workstation asciidoctor pandoc 
$ gem install pygments.rb asciimath 
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kwk/pgo-experiment.git 
$ cd pgo-experiment 
$ kinit <FAS_USER>@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG 
----

* Install packages that you need in order to build the
link:#steps[Steps]. Maybe this list is not capturing everything you need
but at least most of it. `asciidoctor` is optional for building this
documentation using `make docs`.
* OPTIONAL: Installing these ruby gems is only for building these docs
using `make docs`.
* Clone the project including submodules.
* Navigate to the project’s root directory.
* OPTIONAL: If you want to build the steps that involve the `copr` CLI,
you need to have a valid Kerberos ticket. Replace `<FAS_USER>` with the
your own Fedora FAS user name.

== Steps

[[step0]]
=== Step 0 - Build a PGO instrumented LLVM

[NOTE]
====
This step mainly exists for documentation purposes. If you *do* build
this step on your own, make sure to walk through the files where there’s
a reference to
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented]
and change it to your project. I don’t see a need to consider this part
of this excersise. All we have to do is really pass along a few CMake
flags when building the LLVM RPM packages: `llvm`, `clang`, and `lld`.
====

In this step, we’re essentially following the
https://llvm.org/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.html#building-clang-with-pgo[official
documentation] for how to build a PGO instumented clang. In this step
we’re going to create PGO instrumented LLVM packages and host them for
later consumption on a Copr project. The resulting `clang` will generate
profile data upon execution and we’re trying to collect, bundle, and
merge it for optimizing a rebuild of the LLVM toolchain later
(link:#step7[Step 7 - Build PGO optimized LLVM]). But rest assured, you
don’t need to run this on your own. The
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented]
project is ready for you to consume in the next steps. So you’re free to
continue with link:#step1[Step 1 - Build "Hello, World!" RPM].

[[_spec_file_modifications]]
==== Spec file modifications

I’ve set up `pgo-experiment` branches in each of the following package
repositories on the Fedora Source:

[arabic]
. https://src.fedoraproject.org/fork/kkleine/rpms/llvm/tree/pgo-experiment
. https://src.fedoraproject.org/fork/kkleine/rpms/clang/tree/pgo-experiment
. https://src.fedoraproject.org/fork/kkleine/rpms/lld/tree/pgo-experiment

In all of these repositries I’ve essentially done the same changes. At
first I’ve added a
https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/conditionalbuilds.html[build-conditional]
that is off by default:

*step0/llvm/llvm.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%bcond_with pgo_instrumented_build
%bcond_with pgo_optimized_build
----

As you can see, one is for building an instrumented package and one is
for building an optimized package. In link:#step7[Step 7 - Build PGO
optimized LLVM] we’re using the `pgo_optimized_build` but here we’re
only turning on `pgo_instrumented_build` in our `Makefile`:

*step0/Makefile*

[source,make]
----
.PHONY: create-copr-project
create-copr-project:
    -copr create --chroot fedora-37-x86_64 --unlisted-on-hp on $(copr_project)
    -copr modify --chroot fedora-37-x86_64 --unlisted-on-hp on $(copr_project)
    copr edit-chroot --rpmbuild-with pgo_instrumented_build  $(fas_user)/$(copr_project)/fedora-37-x86_64 
----

* Here we modify a particular `fedora-37-x86_64` chroot of the
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented]
project to use `--with pgo_instrumented_build` when invoking `mock` to
build our packages.

Another change I had to make was adding a build dependency on
`compiler-rt`:

*step0/llvm/llvm.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%if %{with pgo_instrumented_build}
BuildRequires: compiler-rt
%endif
----

[NOTE]
====
When building the monorepo all at once you probably don’t notice this
dependency right away.
====

Then we’re modifying the the CMake arguments according to the
https://llvm.org/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.html#building-clang-with-pgo[official
documentation].

*step0/llvm/llvm.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%if %{with pgo_instrumented_build}
    -DLLVM_BUILD_INSTRUMENTED=IR \
    -DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=No \
    -DLLVM_VP_COUNTERS_PER_SITE=8 \
%endif
----

[TIP]
====
There were a couple of errors that I ran into. One basically said:

____
`Error: LLVM Profile Warning: Unable to track new values: Running out of static counters. Consider using option -mllvm -vp-counters-per-site=<n> to allocate more value profile counters at compile time.`
____

As a solution I’ve added the `--vp-counters-per-site` option but this
resulted in a follow-up error:

____
`Error: clang (LLVM option parsing): for the --vp-counters-per-site option: may only occur zero or one times!`
____

The solution was to modify `vp-counters-per-site` option through
`LLVM_VP_COUNTERS_PER_SITE` instead of adding it, hence the
`-DLLVM_VP_COUNTERS_PER_SITE=8`.
====

To build this step, run `make build-step0`.

[[step1]]
=== Step 1 - Build "Hello, World!" RPM

In this step we set the foundation for our experiment.

We have a simple "Hello, World!" application that we build and package
as an RPM file.

[TIP]
====
This step does NOT depend on link:#step0[Step 0 - Build a PGO
instrumented LLVM]. So you should be good to just run
`make build-step1`.
====

The other steps build on this simple setup by first adding lines to the
RPM spec file that we later want to generalize and finally auto-generate
to come back to an unmodified spec file.

Let’s have a look at the link:step1/myapp/myapp.spec[specfile] first:

*step1/myapp/myapp.spec*

[source,spec]
----

%changelog
* Wed Mar 1 2023 Konrad Kleine <kkleine@redhat.com> - 1.0.0-1
- Building step1
----

This is the most simple specfile I could come up with for a "Hello,
World!" application built with `clang`.

The link:step1/myapp/myapp.cpp[application code] itself is similarly
short and throughout this experiment we never change it:

*step1/myapp/myapp.cpp*

[source,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
----

In order to build the RPM we use standard tools like `fedpkg` from a
link:step1/myapp/Makefile[`step1/myapp/Makefile`]:

*step1/myapp/Makefile*

[source,make]
----
# Prepare variables
TMP = $(CURDIR)/tmp
VERSION = $(shell grep ^Version myapp.spec | sed 's/.* //')
PACKAGE = myapp-$(VERSION)
FILES = LICENSE myapp.cpp \
        myapp.spec CMakeLists.txt

.PHONY: source, tarball, rpm, srpm, clean

source:
    mkdir -p $(TMP)/SOURCES
    mkdir -p $(TMP)/$(PACKAGE)
    cp -a $(FILES) $(TMP)/$(PACKAGE)
tarball: source
    cd $(TMP) && tar vcfj ../$(PACKAGE).tar.bz2 $(PACKAGE)
rpm: tarball
    fedpkg --release f37 --name myapp local -- --noclean
srpm: tarball
    fedpkg --release f37 --name myapp srpm
clean:
    rm -rf $(TMP) $(PACKAGE)*
----

Within a link:step1/Containerfile[`Containerfile`] we’re calling
`make rpm` to build the `myapp-1.0.0-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm` RPM:

*step1/Containerfile*

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM fedora:37
LABEL description="A basic specfile-to-RPM process demo"

# Install packages to build and package "myapp"
RUN dnf install -y cmake fedora-packager git clang

WORKDIR /root
RUN useradd --create-home tester
COPY entrypoint.sh /root/entrypoint.sh
COPY ./myapp /home/tester/myapp
RUN chown -Rfv  tester:tester /home/tester/myapp

USER root
ENTRYPOINT [ "/root/entrypoint.sh" ]
----

Once the build is done, we stay in the container (see `bash` in the
following shell script) and you have to manually exit it (e.g. using
`<ctrl>+<d>`). We do this to allow you to look around in the build
directories etc.

*step1/entrypoint.sh*

[source,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash

set -ex

# Build the app and always enter bash for further inspection
cd /home/tester/myapp
su -c "make rpm" tester || true

bash
----

[[step2]]
=== Step 2 - Manually add subpackage

In this step we manually add a `myapp-clang-pgo-profdata` subpackage
which contains PGO profile data from LLVM. This data is generated by
executing a PGO instrumented `clang` from the Copr repo
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented]
which we’ve built in step 0.

The only changes from step1 to step2 are in the the `Containerfile` were
we add the PGO instrumented LLVM.

[source,dockerfile]
----
RUN dnf install -y 'dnf-command(copr)'
RUN dnf copr enable -y kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented
RUN sudo dnf install -y \
    llvm \
    clang
----

[[_subpackage_definition]]
==== Subpackage definition

We add the subpackage manually in step2/myapp/myapp.spec.

[source,spec]
----
%package -n myapp-clang-pgo-profdata

Summary: Indexed PGO profile data from myapp package

%description -n myapp-clang-pgo-profdata 
This package contains profiledata for clang that was generated while
compiling myapp. This can be used for doing Profile Guided Optimizations
(PGO) builds of clang.

%files -n myapp-clang-pgo-profdata
/usr/lib64/clang-pgo-profdata/myapp/myapp.clang.profdata
----

Notice that the added `myapp-clang-pgo-profdata` subpackage requires
this file `/usr/lib64/clang-pgo-profdata/myapp/myapp.clang.profdata`. It
is a file that we have to create manually by invoking the PGO
instrumented `clang`.

[[_set_llvm_profile_file]]
==== Set LLVM_PROFILE_FILE

By specifying `export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="%t/myapp.clang.%m.profraw"` we
instruct `clang` to create a raw profile file for each invocation under
`TMPDIR` (see `%t` in
https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html#running-the-instrumented-program[the
docs]).

*step2/myapp/myapp.spec*

[source,spec]
----
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# We want the profile data to be written to specific files that will
# later land in the sub-package "myapp-clang-raw-pgo-profdata". See
# https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html#running-the-instrumented-program
TMPDIR="%{_builddir}/raw-pgo-profdata"
export TMPDIR
mkdir -pv $TMPDIR
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="%t/myapp.clang.%m.%p.profraw"
export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE
----

[[_find_and_merge_the_profiles]]
==== Find and merge the profiles

We then find all raw profiles and merge them into the final
`myapp.clang.profdata` under the buildroot to be picked up by the
`%files` section of the `myapp-clang-pgo-profdata` subpackage:

*step2/myapp/myapp.spec*

[source,spec]
----
mkdir -pv %{buildroot}/usr/lib64/clang-pgo-profdata/myapp
find %{_builddir}/raw-pgo-profdata \
  -type f \
  -name "myapp.clang.*.profraw" \
  > %{_builddir}/pgo-profiles

# llvm-profdata itself is instrumented and wants to write profile data itself,
# hence we need to specify an LLVM_PROFILE_FILE. Otherwise it tries to write
# to a non existing location coming from when llvm-profdata was built.  
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="llvm-profdata.clang.%m.%p.profraw"
export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE
llvm-profdata merge \
  --compress-all-sections \
  -sparse \
  $(cat %{_builddir}/pgo-profiles) \
  -o %{buildroot}/usr/lib64/clang-pgo-profdata/myapp/myapp.clang.profdata
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Why not store the raw profiles? In the first incarnation of this
experiment I did store the raw profiles and I noticed that the final
`myapp-clang-pgo-profdata` RPM was 128MB in size. When we first merge
the profiles we get it down to ~900KB. I did a similar experiment for
the `retsnoop` project and there the effect was also very big: ~1,4GB
for raw profile data down to ~1,6MB for merged one.
====

[TIP]
====
You can call `llvm-profdata merge` on already merged profiles!
====

Now, you may ask why we make the changes to the spec file at all when I
promised that we get profile data from unmodified packages. The honest
answer is that I didn’t know how to do it when I started out this
experiment and I found the manual way much more easy to follow along
compared to presenting the solution right away. This way we make
transparent what needs to be generalized and automated.

In the next step we’re going to generalize the manual addition of the
subpackage before we remove it entirely from the spec file again.

[[_try_it_out_yourself]]
==== Try it out yourself

I encourage you to run this step yourself and follow along these steps
to get a feeling for what the profile data does provide.

[CAUTION]
====
When experimenting with different templates I noticed that `%Nm`
(e.g.`%2m`) causes `counter overflow` messages. The reason for this was
discussed in
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=801362[this
thread]. That’s why I’ve switched to using `%p` instead of `%Nm` but I
wonder if this causes problems for multithreaded workloads. To recap,
this is what `%Nm` does in the `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE`:

____
`%Nm` expands out to the instrumented binary’s signature. When this
pattern is specified, the runtime creates a pool of `N\'` raw profiles
which are used for on-line profile merging. The runtime takes care of
selecting a raw profile from the pool, locking it, and updating it
before the program exits. If N is not specified (i.e the pattern is
“%m”), it’s assumed that N = 1. N must be between 1 and 9. The merge
pool specifier can only occur once per filename pattern.
(https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html#running-the-instrumented-program[Source])
____

Afterall, how can a function call be counted in a thread-safe manner?
Let’s suppose you have four threads that all call a specific function
`foo()` once. After merging the counters using `llvm-profdata merge` the
value is obviously `1+1+1+1=4`. But with `%2m` you get very weird
results.
====

[[step3]]
=== Step 3 - Generalize subpackage

In this step we generalize the `myapp-clang-pgo-profdata` subpackage
from step 2 to `%{name}-%{toolchain}-clang-pgo-profdata`.

The only changes from step2 to step3 is in the `myapp/myapp.spec` file:

[[_subpackage_definition_2]]
==== Subpackage definition

*step3/myapp/myapp.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%package -n %{name}-%{toolchain}-raw-pgo-profdata

Summary: Indexed PGO profile data from %{name} package

%description -n %{name}-%{toolchain}-raw-pgo-profdata 
This package contains profiledata for %{toolchain} that was generated while
compiling %{name}. This can be used for doing Profile Guided Optimizations
(PGO) builds of %{toolchain}.

%files -n %{name}-%{toolchain}-raw-pgo-profdata
%{_libdir}/%{toolchain}-pgo-profdata/%{name}/%{name}.%{toolchain}.profdata
----

[[_set_llvm_profile_file_2]]
==== Set LLVM_PROFILE_FILE

*step3/myapp/myapp.spec*

[source,spec]
----
TMPDIR="%{_builddir}/raw-pgo-profdata"
export TMPDIR
mkdir -pv $TMPDIR
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="%t/%{name}.%{toolchain}.%m.%p.profraw"
export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE
----

[[_find_and_merge_profiles]]
==== Find and merge profiles

*step3/myapp/myapp.spec*

[source,spec]
----
mkdir -pv %{buildroot}%{_libdir}/%{toolchain}-pgo-profdata/%{name}
find %{_builddir}/raw-pgo-profdata \
  -type f \

  > %{_builddir}/pgo-profiles

# llvm-profdata itself is instrumented and wants to write profile data itself,
# hence we need to specify an LLVM_PROFILE_FILE. Otherwise it tries to write
# to a non existing location coming from when llvm-profdata was built.  
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="llvm-profdata.clang.%m.%p.profraw"
llvm-profdata merge \
  --compress-all-sections \
  -sparse \
  $(cat %{_builddir}/pgo-profiles) \
  -o %{buildroot}%{_libdir}/%{toolchain}-pgo-profdata/%{name}/%{name}.%{toolchain}.profdata
----

You should see that we’ve replaced all occurrences of `myapp` with the
RPM specfile macro `%{name}` and the word `clang` with the
`%{toolchain}` macro. That is essentially all we have to do now.

[NOTE]
====
You can specify `%global toolchain clang` to have your code compile with
clang and use all the right and sane defaults for compiler flags for
clang. See
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#_compiler_macros.
====

[[step4]]
=== Step 4 - Automatically add subpackage

In this step we use the `myapp` directory from `step1` that doesn’t
contain any information about the subpackage at all. And yet we’re still
gonna get our subpackage with profile data. We do this by patching,
compiling and installing another package that is always present on
Fedora: `redhat-rpm-config`. This package is the home of many useful
build-flags and macros but it also allows us to tap into the build
process by.

[[_toggle]]
==== Toggle

To toggle the profile generation on an off we have defined the
`%_toolchain_profile_subpackages`. It is on by default and to disable
the generation of profile subpackages you need to specify
`%global _toolchain_profile_subpackages %{nil}` this in your specfile.

*step4/redhat-rpm-config/macros*

%_toolchain_profile_subpackages 1
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently there’s no sanity checking of whether or not a package can
even produce PGO profiles. If there’s no compiler or the compiler is not
clang, my patch doesn’t work. But right now we don’t care so much about
this and consider it an optimization for later. I just wanted to let you
know.
====

[[_subpackage_template]]
=== Subpackage template

The subpackage can be generalized with the following template.

*step4/redhat-rpm-config/macros*

[source,spec]
----
# Generate profiledata packages for the compiler

[[_set_llvm_profile_file_3]]
==== Set LLVM_PROFILE_FILE

We export the `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` environment variable at the right
place.

[[_find_and_merge_profiles_2]]
==== Find and merge profiles

We tap in the post-`%install` step to find and merge the profiles into
the buildroot location.

*step4/redhat-rpm-config/macros*

[source,spec]
----
%__copy_profraw %[ 0%{_toolchain_profile_subpackages} > 0 ?

[[_build_redhat_rpm_config_package]]
==== Build redhat-rpm-config package

In order to build the `redhat-rpm-config` we build the package using
`fedpkg local`. Then we can simply imstall the resulting RPM using
`dnf`:

*step4/entrypoint.sh*

[source,shell]
----
# Build and install our customized redhat-rpm-config
cd /root/redhat-rpm-config
fedpkg --release f37 local
sudo dnf install -y --disablerepo=* noarch/redhat-rpm-config-230-1.fc37.noarch.rpm
----

NOTICE: There’s no `step4/myapp` directory. This is because we copy it
from step1 in the top-level link:Makefile[`Makefile`]. This is supposed
to emphasize the point that we don’t modify the spec file:

*Makefile*

[source,make]
----
build-step4:
    rm -rf step4/myapp
    cp -rf step1/myapp step4/myapp
    podman build -t pgo-experiment-step4 ./step4
    podman run -it --rm pgo-experiment-step4
----

[[step5]]
=== Step 5 - Build unmodified packages on Copr

[NOTE]
====
You don’t need to run this step manually. It has already been run and
the results are in the Copr project
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/profile-data-collection].
====

Up until this point all of our experiments look promising but how can we
use Copr to build packages and produce `<PACKAGE>-clang-profdata`
packages automatically for us?

Copr will become the storage for our profile data subpackages with all
the rest of the regular packages.

After running this step using `make build-step5`, we’re gonna have a
project called:
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/profile-data-collection].

In that project, there will be the patched `redhat-rpm-config` package
and the `myapp` package with the additional subpackage inside:

image:profile-data-collection.png[profile data collection]

In order for the Copr project to use our PGO instrumented LLVM we’ve
made the repo available in the link:step5/Makefile[`step5/Makefile`]
using the `--repo` option:

*step5/Makefile*

[source,make]
----
.PHONY: create-copr-project
create-copr-project:
    -copr create --chroot fedora-37-x86_64 --unlisted-on-hp on --repo copr://$(fas_user)/llvm-pgo-instrumented $(copr_project)
    copr modify --chroot fedora-37-x86_64 --unlisted-on-hp on --repo copr://$(fas_user)/llvm-pgo-instrumented $(copr_project)
----

Any package that will be built after `redhat-rpm-config` in the
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/profile-data-collection]
Copr project will automatically have a `<package>-clang-profdata`
subpackage that we can download in a later step to merge and feed it in
the final, optimized build of LLVM.

[[_optional_build_from_distgit]]
=== Optional: Build from distgit

If you want, you can build any project from Fedora’s distigt by doing

[source,console]
----
$ cd step5/
$ make distgit-<PACKAGE> 
----

* Replace `<PACKAGE>` with a real package name, e.g. `chromium`, or
`retsnoop`.

This is backed by this special target in the
link:step5/Makefile[`step5/Makefile`]:

*step5/Makefile*

[source,make]
----
# Build an arbitrary package from dist-git
distgit-%:
    $(eval package:=$(subst distgit-,,$@))
    -copr add-package-distgit \
        --name $(package) \
        --distgit fedora \
        --commit f37 \
        $(fas_user)/$(copr_project)
    copr edit-package-distgit \
        --name $(package) \
        --distgit fedora \
        --commit f37 \
        $(fas_user)/$(copr_project)
    copr build-package \
        --name $(package) \
        --timeout 108000 \
        --nowait \
        --chroot fedora-37-x86_64 \
        $(fas_user)/$(copr_project)
----

[NOTE]
====
You might wonder why we first add and then edit a package. This is
because we don’t know if the package has already been added before. And
to overwrite with the desired values we simply edit an added project
right away. So, nothing really special.
====

[[step6]]
=== Step 6 - Merge Raw Profiles

In order to optimize LLVM with the raw profile data that we’ve collected
before we need to make it available to the Copr build of LLVM and we
need to
https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-profdata.html#profdata-merge[merge]
it using `llvm-profdata merge`.

____
[Merging] takes several profile data files generated by PGO
instrumentation and merges them together into a single indexed profile
data file.
(https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-profdata.html#profdata-merge[Source])
____

The `<PACKAGE>-clang-profdata` packages that we’ve build so far are
installable standalone. When we build a PGO optimized version of LLVM we
add a `BuildRequires: myapp-clang-pgo-profdata` to the spec file of a
new package called `llvm-pgo-profdata`.

*step6/llvm-pgo-profdata/llvm-pgo-profdata.spec*

[source,spec]
----
BuildRequires: myapp-clang-pgo-profdata
BuildRequires: retsnoop-clang-pgo-profdata
BuildRequires: chromium-clang-pgo-profdata
----

The `%build` section of our `llvm-pgo-profdata` spec file merges the
profiles provided by the above `<PACKAGE>-clang-pgo-profdata` packages
to create a single PGO profile data file that we can later use for
building a PGO optimized LLVM toolchain.

*step6/llvm-pgo-profdata/llvm-pgo-profdata.spec*

[source,spec]
----
llvm-profdata merge \
      %{_libdir}/%{toolchain}-pgo-profdata/myapp/* \
      %{_libdir}/%{toolchain}-pgo-profdata/retsnoop/* \
      %{_libdir}/%{toolchain}-pgo-profdata/chromium/* \
      -output llvm-pgo.profdata
%files
%license LICENSE
%{_libdir}/%{toolchain}-pgo-profdata/llvm-pgo.profdata
----

[CAUTION]
====
The `llvm-pgo-profdata` package will be build on Copr in the
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/profile-data-collection]
project and as you may recall from earlier, we have our patched
`redhat-config-rpm` package living there as well. That means by default
the `llvm-pgo-profdata` is expected to output PGO profiles. In reality
it doesn’t do that and so we’re disabling the profile generation
manually:

*step6/llvm-pgo-profdata/llvm-pgo-profdata.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%global _toolchain_profile_subpackages %{nil}
----
====

In Fedora as well as RHEL and CentOS Stream we use a build mode called
"standalone-build". That means, we’re building each sub-project of LLVM
(e.g. `clang`, `llvm`, `lld`) with its own specfile. To avoid merging
the PGO profile data into an indexed profile data file more than once
we’re offloading the merge process into its own RPM. We call it
`llvm-pgo-profdata`.

[[step7]]
=== Step 7 - Build PGO optimized LLVM

This step is similar to link:#step0[Step 0 - Build a PGO instrumented
LLVM] in which we’ve build the PGO instrumented LLVM. Here we’re adding
a build requirement for `llvm-pgo-profdata`:

*step7/llvm/llvm.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%if %{with pgo_optimized_build}
BuildRequires: llvm-pgo-profdata
%endif
----

We then use the file
`%{_libdir}/%{toolchain}-pgo-profdata/llvm-pgo.profdata` provided by our
`llvm-prog-profdata` package as input to `LLVM_PROFDATA_FILE`:

*step7/llvm/llvm.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%if %{with pgo_optimized_build}
    -DLLVM_PROFDATA_FILE=%{_libdir}/%{toolchain}-pgo-profdata/llvm-pgo.profdata \
%endif
----

Together with the proper `--with pgo_optimized_build`
https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/conditionalbuilds.html[build-conditional],
we’re building the optimized `llvm`, `clang` and `lld` packages:

*step7/Makefile*

[source,make]
----
.PHONY: create-copr-project
create-copr-project:
    -copr create --chroot fedora-37-x86_64 --unlisted-on-hp on --repo copr://$(fas_user)/profile-data-collection $(copr_project)
    copr  modify --chroot fedora-37-x86_64 --unlisted-on-hp on --repo copr://$(fas_user)/profile-data-collection $(copr_project)
    copr edit-chroot --rpmbuild-with pgo_optimized_build $(copr_project)/fedora-37-x86_64
----

The resulting PGO optimized packages are available on
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/llvm-pgo-optimized].

[[_conclusion]]
== Conclusion

We’ve seen how we can gather PGO profile data from building unmodified
RPM packages and feed this data into a PGO-optimized recompilation of
LLVM.

Next on our list is:

* Maybe move our additional code from `redhat-rpm-config` to some LLVM
subpackage.
* Build for more architectures.
+
[NOTE]
====
By default we optimize for each individual architecture. We think that
this is good for now. The cases in which you want to cross-compile on
one architecture for another exists but are not considered here (for
now).
====
* Benchmark a PGO-optimized LLVM toolchain with CTMark on
http://llvm-compile-time-tracker.com/.

I hope you liked this article and follow us exploring the possibilities
ahead of us! Don’t forget to leave a comment ;)
