# Step 2

In this step we manually add a `myapp-clang-profdata` sub-package which contains
PGO profile data from LLVM. This data is generated by executing a PGO
instrumented `clang` from this Copr repo
[kkleine/llvm-pgo-producing-builds](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-producing-builds/).
The "workload" so to speak is the compilation of the `myapp` package, not its
execution.

The only changes from step1 to step2 should be in the `Containerfile`, adding
the PGO instrumented LLVM, and in the `myapp/myapp.spec` file where we add the
subpackage.

In the next step we're generalizing the manual addition of the sub-package
before we remove it entirely from the spec file.
