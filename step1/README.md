# Step 1

In this step we set the foundation for our experiment.

We have a simply "Hello, World!" application that we build and package as an RPM
file.

The other steps build on this simple setup by first adding lines to the RPM spec
file that we later want to generalize and finally auto-generate to come back to
an unmodified spec file.
