toc::[]
In this experiment we generate PGO profile data from compiling
unmodified RPM packages with a PGO instrumented LLVM and feed those
profiles into a PGO optimized rebuild of LLVM.

[[_overview]]
== Overview

We create an instrumented LLVM toolchain in a Copr project called
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented].
In another Copr project called
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/profile-data-collection]
we install a new package called `llvm-pgo-instrumented-macros`. Every
package that gets built in that project will automatically produce a
subpackage `<PACKAGE>-llvm-pgo-profdata` with PGO profile data. We
demonstrate this with a simple "Hello, World!" application that is
called `myapp`. We then collect all those subpackages through
`BuildRequires:` tags in another package called `llvm-pgo-profdata`.
During the build of this `llvm-pgo-profdata` package, all profiles are
merged into an indexed profile data file. The final `llvm-pgo-profdata`
RPM then installs the indexed profile data file into a location from
which a PGO optimized build of LLVM can read it. This PGO optimized
build of the LLVM toolchain is done in a third Copr project called
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/llvm-pgo-optimized].

[[_non_goals]]
=== Non-goals

It is not a goal to get a perfectly tweaked PGO optimization build of
LLVM. Instead we want to explore a way how to setup a pipeline in
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/[Copr] for further tweaking and
experimentation.

It is also not a goal to change from the standalone build mode to a
mono-repo build with a single buildroot. But rest assured, we’re looking
into merging the `llvm` and `clang` RPM packages into one so that we can
apply PGO and LTO in a more holistic way.

The only operating system that we build for in this experiment is Fedora
rawhide on x86_64.

[NOTE]
====
This is potentially a bit risky because the the profile data may become
irrelevant more quickly compared to less frequently updated variants of
Fedora. But rawhide is the version of choice for introducing new
profiles.
====

[[_understand_what_pgo_can_do]]
== Understand what PGO can do

____
PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization) allows your compiler to better
optimize code for how it actually runs. Users report that applying this
to Clang and LLVM can decrease overall compile time by 20%.
(https://llvm.org/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.html#introduction[Source])
____

____
Profile information enables better optimization. For example, knowing
that a branch is taken very frequently helps the compiler make better
decisions when ordering basic blocks. Knowing that a function `foo` is
called more frequently than another function `bar` helps the inliner.
Optimization levels `-O2` and above are recommended for use of profile
guided optimization. […​] [Be] careful to collect profiles by running
your code with inputs that are representative of the typical behavior.
Code that is not exercised in the profile will be optimized as if it is
unimportant, and the compiler may make poor optimization choices for
code that is disproportionately used while profiling.
(https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#profile-guided-optimization[Source])
____

For the https://getfedora.org/[Fedora Linux] distribution we build a ton
of packages with LLVM. The aforementioned *inputs* are these packages
themselves. The programs to optimize are those under the LLVM umbrella
(e.g. `clang`).

The question is: How can we tap in the RPM build pipeline using
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/[Copr] and build RPM packages without
modifying their `*.spec` files manually?

I’ve created a multi-step experiment that shows how this can be
achieved. For educational purposes I’ve written many of the steps using
`Containerfile` s. This allows for a good level of isolation when you
want to build the steps on your own. To run any of the steps on your
own, you can run `make build-stepX` where
latexmath:[$X\backslash \in \left\{ {0,1,2,\ldots,8} \right\}$]. But
make sure you first read the description for each step below. Sometimes
a step really only serves a documentation purpose.

[NOTE]
====
The Containerfiles run as `root`. Afterall the resulting images are not
meant for anything but demonstration purposes and MUST NOT be used in
production sites.
====

[[_how_to_follow_along]]
=== How to follow along?

I’ve been writing and testing everything on a
https://getfedora.org/[Fedora Linux] 37 laptop.

Here’s a good starting point for preparing your system if you want to
follow along. Don’t worry we don’t install any custom RPM on your
system. Everything is build either in a podman container or on
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/[Copr].

[source,console]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y git make fedpkg podman fedora-packager krb5-workstation asciidoctor pandoc 
$ gem install pygments.rb asciimath 
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kwk/pgo-experiment.git 
$ cd pgo-experiment 
$ kinit <FAS_USER>@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG 
----

* Install packages that you need in order to build the
link:#steps[Steps]. Maybe this list is not capturing everything you need
but at least most of it. `asciidoctor` is optional for building this
documentation using `make docs`.
* OPTIONAL: Installing these ruby gems is only for building these docs
using `make docs`.
* Clone the project including submodules.
* Navigate to the project’s root directory.
* OPTIONAL: If you want to build the steps that involve the `copr` CLI,
you need to have a valid Kerberos ticket. Replace `<FAS_USER>` with the
your own Fedora FAS user name.

== Steps

[[step0]]
=== Step 0 - Build a PGO instrumented LLVM

[NOTE]
====
This step mainly exists for documentation purposes. If you *do* build
this step on your own, make sure to walk through the files where there’s
a reference to
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented]
and change it to your project. I don’t see a need to consider this part
of this excersise. All we have to do is really pass along a few CMake
flags when building these LLVM RPM packages: `llvm`, `clang`, and `lld`.
====

In this step, we’re essentially following the
https://llvm.org/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.html#building-clang-with-pgo[official
documentation] for how to build a PGO instumented clang. We’re going to
create PGO instrumented LLVM packages and host them for later
consumption on a Copr project. The resulting `clang` will generate
profile data upon execution and we’re trying to collect, bundle, and
merge it for optimizing a rebuild of the LLVM toolchain later
(link:#step7[Step 7 - Build PGO optimized LLVM]). But rest assured, you
don’t need to run this on your own. A build takes a couple of hours. The
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented]
project is ready for you to consume in the next steps. So you’re free to
continue with link:#step1[Step 1 - Build "Hello, World!" RPM].

[[_spec_file_modifications]]
==== Spec file modifications

I’ve set up `pgo-experiment` branches in each of the following package
repositories on the Fedora Source:

[arabic]
. https://src.fedoraproject.org/fork/kkleine/rpms/llvm/tree/pgo-experiment
. https://src.fedoraproject.org/fork/kkleine/rpms/clang/tree/pgo-experiment
. https://src.fedoraproject.org/fork/kkleine/rpms/lld/tree/pgo-experiment

In all of these repositries I’ve essentially done the same changes. At
first I’ve added a
https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/conditionalbuilds.html[build-conditional]
that is off by default:

*step0/llvm/llvm.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%bcond_with pgo_instrumented_build
%bcond_with pgo_optimized_build
----

As you can see, one is for building an instrumented package and one is
for building an optimized package. In link:#step7[Step 7 - Build PGO
optimized LLVM] we’re using the `pgo_optimized_build` but here we’re
only turning on `pgo_instrumented_build` in our `Makefile`:

*step0/Makefile*

[source,make]
----
.PHONY: create-copr-project
create-copr-project:
    -copr create fedora-rawhide-x86_64 --unlisted-on-hp on $(copr_project)
    -copr modify fedora-rawhide-x86_64 --unlisted-on-hp on $(copr_project)
    copr edit-chroot --rpmbuild-with pgo_instrumented_build $(fas_user)/$(copr_project)/fedora-rawhide-x86_64
----

Another change I had to make was adding a build dependency on
`compiler-rt`:

*step0/llvm/llvm.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%if %{with pgo_instrumented_build}
BuildRequires: compiler-rt
%endif
----

Then we’re modifying the the CMake arguments according to the
https://llvm.org/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.html#building-clang-with-pgo[official
documentation].

*step0/llvm/llvm.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%if %{with pgo_instrumented_build}
    -DLLVM_BUILD_INSTRUMENTED=IR \
    -DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=No \
    -DLLVM_VP_COUNTERS_PER_SITE=8 \
%endif
----

[TIP]
====
There were a couple of errors that I ran into. One basically said:

____
`Error: LLVM Profile Warning: Unable to track new values: Running out of static counters. Consider using option -mllvm -vp-counters-per-site=<n> to allocate more value profile counters at compile time.`
____

As a solution I’ve added the `--vp-counters-per-site` option but this
resulted in a follow-up error:

____
`Error: clang (LLVM option parsing): for the --vp-counters-per-site option: may only occur zero or one times!`
____

The solution was to modify `vp-counters-per-site` option through
`LLVM_VP_COUNTERS_PER_SITE` instead of adding it, hence the
`-DLLVM_VP_COUNTERS_PER_SITE=8`.
====

[[_building_step_0]]
==== Building Step 0

To build this step, run `make build-step0`.

[[step1]]
=== Step 1 - Build "Hello, World!" RPM

In this step we set the foundation for our experiment.

We have a simple "Hello, World!" application that we build and package
as an RPM file.

[TIP]
====
This step does NOT depend on link:#step0[Step 0 - Build a PGO
instrumented LLVM]. So you should be good to just run
`make build-step1`.
====

Let’s have a look at the link:step1/myapp/myapp.spec[specfile] first:

*step1/myapp/myapp.spec*

[source,spec]

%changelog
* Wed Mar 1 2023 Konrad Kleine <kkleine@redhat.com> - 1.0.0-1
- Building step1
----

This is the most simple specfile I could come up with for a "Hello,
World!" application built with `clang`.

The link:step1/myapp/myapp.cpp[application code] itself is similarly
short and throughout this experiment we never change it:

*step1/myapp/myapp.cpp*

[source,cpp]
----
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
----

In order to build the RPM we use standard tools like `fedpkg` from a
link:step1/myapp/Makefile[`step1/myapp/Makefile`]:

*step1/myapp/Makefile*

[source,make]
----
# Prepare variables
TMP = $(CURDIR)/tmp
VERSION = $(shell grep ^Version myapp.spec | sed 's/.* //')
PACKAGE = myapp-$(VERSION)
FILES = LICENSE myapp.cpp \
        myapp.spec CMakeLists.txt

.PHONY: source, tarball, rpm, srpm, clean

source:
    mkdir -p $(TMP)/SOURCES
    mkdir -p $(TMP)/$(PACKAGE)
    cp -a $(FILES) $(TMP)/$(PACKAGE)
tarball: source
    cd $(TMP) && tar vcfj ../$(PACKAGE).tar.bz2 $(PACKAGE)
rpm: tarball
    fedpkg --release f37 --name myapp local -- --noclean
srpm: tarball
    fedpkg --release f37 --name myapp srpm
clean:
    rm -rf $(TMP) $(PACKAGE)* x86_64 .build-*.log
----

Within a link:step1/Containerfile[`Containerfile`] we’re calling
`make rpm` to build the `myapp-1.0.0-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm` RPM:

*step1/Containerfile*

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM fedora:rawhide
LABEL description="A basic specfile-to-RPM process demo"

# Install packages to build and package "myapp"
RUN dnf install -y cmake fedora-packager git clang

WORKDIR /root
COPY entrypoint.sh /root/entrypoint.sh
COPY ./myapp /root/myapp

USER root
ENTRYPOINT [ "/root/entrypoint.sh" ]
----

Once the build is done, we stay in the container (see `bash` in the
following shell script) and you have to manually exit it (e.g. using
[.keycombo]#Ctrl+d#). We do this to allow you to look around in the
build directories etc.

*step1/entrypoint.sh*

[source,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash

set -x

cd /root/myapp
make rpm || true

bash
----

[[_building_step_1]]
==== Building Step 1

To build this step, run `make build-step1`.

When you build this step, the output should look like this:

[source,console]
----
[...]
Wrote: /root/myapp/myapp-1.0.0-1.fc37.src.rpm

+ bash
[root@7cf29caa0097 myapp]#
----

[[step4]]
=== Step 4 - Automatically add subpackage

In this step we use the `myapp` directory from `step1` that doesn’t
contain any information about the subpackage at all. And yet we’re still
gonna get our subpackage with profile data. Let’s dive right in…​

[[_building_step_4]]
==== Building Step 4

To build this step, run `make build-step4`.

When you build this step, the output should look like this:

[source,console]
----
[...]
Wrote: /root/myapp/myapp-1.0.0-1.fc37.src.rpm
Wrote: /root/myapp/x86_64/myapp-1.0.0-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm

+ bash
[root@7cf29caa0097 myapp]#
----

How is it possible, that we got an additional
`myapp-llvm-pgo-profdata-1.0.0-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm` without changing the
spec file?

We do this by installing a special macros package:
`llvm-pgo-instrumentation-macros`. This package is the home of many
useful build-flags and macros but it also allows us to tap into the
build process:

*step4/Containerfile*

[source,shell]
----
# Install the PGO instrumented (not PGO optimized!) LLVM Toolchain
# https://llvm.org/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.html#building-clang-with-pgo We have
# to specify the version we want because rawhide could have moved on by now.
RUN dnf install -y 'dnf-command(copr)'
RUN dnf copr enable -y kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented
RUN dnf install -y \
    clang-16.0.2-2.fc39 \
    clang-libs-16.0.2-2.fc39 \
    clang-resource-filesystem-16.0.2-2.fc39 \
    llvm-16.0.2-2.fc39 \
    llvm-libs-16.0.2-2.fc39 \
    llvm-pgo-instrumentation-macros-16.0.2-2.fc39
----

We store our RPM macros for PGO in the `/etc/rpm/` directory which is
usually dedicated towards per-host overrides `/We need to override
macros that _exist only fairly late_ in the list of the macro path that
is executed from left to right:

[source,console]
----
$ rpm --showrc|grep -i "macro path"
Macro path: /usr/lib/rpm/macros:/usr/lib/rpm/macros.d/macros.*:/usr/lib/rpm/platform/%{_target}/macros:/usr/lib/rpm/fileattrs/*.attr:/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros:/etc/rpm/macros.*:/etc/rpm/macros:/etc/rpm/%{_target}/macros:~/.rpmmacros
----

A natrual choice would have been to pick `%{_rpmmacrodir}` which expands
to `/usr/lib/rpm/macros.d` but then we wouldn’t be able to override
macros from the `redhat-rpm-config` package (see
https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/redhat-rpm-config/pull-request/249#comment-138527[this
pr]).

[[_summary]]
=== Summary

It is important to note that in order to achieve the additional
subpackage, we only had to modify the LLVM package and no other
packages.

[[step5]]
=== Step 5 - Build unmodified packages on Copr

[NOTE]
====
You don’t need to run this step manually. It has already been run and
the results are in the Copr project
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/profile-data-collection].
====

Up until this point all of our experiments look promising but how can we
use Copr to build packages and produce `<PACKAGE>-llvm-pgo-profdata`
packages automatically for us?

Copr will become the storage for our profile data subpackages with all
the rest of the regular packages.

After running this step using `make build-step5`, we’re gonna have a
project called:
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/profile-data-collection].

In that project, there will be the patched package and the `myapp`
package with the additional subpackage inside:

image:profile-data-collection.png[profile data collection]

In order for the Copr project to use our PGO instrumented LLVM we’ve
made the repo available in the link:step5/Makefile[`step5/Makefile`]
using the `--repo` option:

*step5/Makefile*

[source,make]
----
.PHONY: create-copr-project
create-copr-project:
    -copr create --chroot fedora-rawhide-x86_64 --unlisted-on-hp on --repo copr://$(fas_user)/llvm-pgo-instrumented $(copr_project)
    copr modify --chroot fedora-rawhide-x86_64 --unlisted-on-hp on --repo copr://$(fas_user)/llvm-pgo-instrumented $(copr_project)
    copr edit-chroot --packages llvm-pgo-instrumentation-macros $(fas_user)/profile-data-collection/fedora-rawhide-x86_64
----

Any package that will be built in the
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/profile-data-collection]
Copr project will automatically have a `<package>-clang-profdata`
subpackage that we can download in a later step to merge and feed it in
the final, optimized build of LLVM.

[[_optional_build_from_distgit]]
==== Optional: Build from distgit

If you want, you can build any project from Fedora’s distigt by doing:

[source,console]
----
$ cd step5/
$ make distgit-<PACKAGE> 
----

* Replace `<PACKAGE>` with a real package name, e.g. `retsnoop`, or
`chromium`.

This is backed by this special target in the
link:step5/Makefile[`step5/Makefile`]:

*step5/Makefile*

[source,make]
----
# Build an arbitrary package from dist-git
distgit-%:
    $(eval package:=$(subst distgit-,,$@))
    -copr add-package-distgit \
        --name $(package) \
        --distgit fedora \
        --commit rawhide \
        $(fas_user)/$(copr_project)
    copr edit-package-distgit \
        --name $(package) \
        --distgit fedora \
        --commit rawhide \
        $(fas_user)/$(copr_project)
    # copr edit-chroot --rpmbuild-with clang $(fas_user)/profile-data-collection/fedora-rawhide-x86_64
    copr build-package \
        --name $(package) \
        --timeout 1728000 \
        --nowait \
        --chroot fedora-rawhide-x86_64 \
        $(fas_user)/$(copr_project)
----

[NOTE]
====
You might wonder why we first add and then edit a package. This is
because we don’t know if the package has already been added before. And
to overwrite with the desired values we simply edit an added project
right away. So, nothing really special.
====

[[step6]]
=== Step 6 - Merge Raw Profiles

In order to optimize LLVM with the raw profile data that we’ve collected
before we need to make it available to the Copr build of LLVM and we
need to
https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-profdata.html#profdata-merge[merge]
it using `llvm-profdata merge`.

____
[Merging] takes several profile data files generated by PGO
instrumentation and merges them together into a single indexed profile
data file.
(https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-profdata.html#profdata-merge[Source])
____

The `<PACKAGE>-llvm-pgo-profdata` packages that we’ve build so far are
installable standalone. When we build a PGO optimized version of LLVM we
add a `BuildRequires: myapp-llvm-pgo-profdata` to the spec file of a new
package called `llvm-pgo-profdata`.

*step6/llvm-pgo-profdata/llvm-pgo-profdata.spec*

[source,spec]
----
BuildRequires: myapp-llvm-pgo-profdata
BuildRequires: retsnoop-llvm-pgo-profdata
----

The `%build` section of our `llvm-pgo-profdata` spec file merges the
profiles provided by the above `<PACKAGE>-llvm-pgo-profdata` packages to
create a single PGO profile data file that we can later use for building
a PGO optimized LLVM toolchain.

*step6/llvm-pgo-profdata/llvm-pgo-profdata.spec*

[source,spec]
----
llvm-profdata merge \
      --compress-all-sections \
      --sparse \
      %{_libdir}/llvm-pgo-profdata/myapp/* \
      %{_libdir}/llvm-pgo-profdata/retsnoop/* \
      -output llvm-pgo.profdata
%files
%license LICENSE
%{_libdir}/llvm-pgo-profdata/llvm-pgo.profdata
----

[CAUTION]
====
The `llvm-pgo-profdata` package will be build on Copr in the
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kkleine/llvm-pgo-instrumented/[kkleine/profile-data-collection]
project. That means by default the `llvm-pgo-profdata` is expected to
output PGO profiles. In reality it doesn’t do that and so we’re
disabling the profile generation manually:

*step6/llvm-pgo-profdata/llvm-pgo-profdata.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%global __llvm_pgo_subpackage %{nil}
----
====

In Fedora as well as RHEL and CentOS Stream we use a build mode called
"standalone-build". That means, we’re building each sub-project of LLVM
(e.g. `clang`, `llvm`, `lld`) with its own specfile. To avoid merging
the PGO profile data into an indexed profile data file more than once
we’re offloading the merge process into its own RPM. We call it
`llvm-pgo-profdata`.

[[step7]]
=== Step 7 - Build PGO optimized LLVM

This step is similar to link:#step0[Step 0 - Build a PGO instrumented
LLVM] in which we’ve build the PGO instrumented LLVM. Here we’re adding
a build requirement for `llvm-pgo-profdata`:

*step7/llvm/llvm.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%if %{with pgo_optimized_build}
BuildRequires: llvm-pgo-profdata
%endif
----

We then use the file `%{_libdir}/llvm-pgo-profdata/llvm-pgo.profdata`
provided by our `llvm-prog-profdata` package as input to
`LLVM_PROFDATA_FILE`:

*step7/llvm/llvm.spec*

[source,spec]
----
%if %{with pgo_optimized_build}
    -DLLVM_PROFDATA_FILE=%{_libdir}/llvm-pgo-profdata/llvm-pgo.profdata \
%endif
----

Together with the proper `--with pgo_optimized_build`
https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/conditionalbuilds.html[build-conditional],
we’re building the optimized `llvm`, `clang` and `lld` packages:

*step7/Makefile*

[source,make]
----
.PHONY: create-copr-project

[[TMPDIR]]
=== What is the LLVM_PROFILE_FILE environment variable?

By specifying `export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="%t/myapp.llvm.%m.%p.profraw"`
we instruct `clang` to create a raw profile file for each invocation
under `TMPDIR` (see `%t` in
https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html#running-the-instrumented-program[the
docs]).

[CAUTION]
====
When experimenting with different *templates* I noticed that `%Nm`
(e.g.`%2m`) causes `counter overflow` messages. The reason for this was
discussed in
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=801362[this
thread]. That’s why I’ve switched to using `%p` instead of `%Nm` but I
wonder if this causes problems for multithreaded workloads. To recap,
this is what `%Nm` does in the `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE`:

____
`%Nm` expands out to the instrumented binary’s signature. When this
pattern is specified, the runtime creates a pool of `N\'` raw profiles
which are used for on-line profile merging. The runtime takes care of
selecting a raw profile from the pool, locking it, and updating it
before the program exits. If N is not specified (i.e the pattern is
“%m”), it’s assumed that N = 1. N must be between 1 and 9. The merge
pool specifier can only occur once per filename pattern.
(https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html#running-the-instrumented-program[Source])
____

Afterall, how can a function call be counted in a thread-safe manner?
Let’s suppose you have four threads that all call a specific function
`foo()` once. After merging the counters using `llvm-profdata merge` the
value is obviously `1+1+1+1=4`. But with `%2m` you get very weird
results.
====

[[find_and_merge_profiles]]
=== Why do we merge profiles and not keep the raw ones?

Short answer: because size matters!

In the `%install` section of the specfile we then find all raw profiles
and merge them into the final
`%{buildroot}%{_libdir}/llvm-pgo-profdata/%{name}/%{name}.llvm.profdata`
under the buildroot to be picked up by the `%files` section of the
`%{name}-llvm-pgo-profdata` subpackage:

*macros.llvm-pgo-instrumentation-setup*

[source,spec]
----
%__pgo_merge_profdata %[ 0%{__llvm_pgo_subpackage} > 0 ? "\\\
  mkdir -pv %{buildroot}%{_libdir}/llvm-pgo-profdata/%{name} \\\
  && %{__pgo_env} \\\
  && llvm-profdata merge \\\
    --compress-all-sections \\\
    --sparse \\\
    %{__pgo_background_merge_target} \\\
    $(find %{_builddir}/raw-pgo-profdata -type f -name '*.profraw') \\\
    -o %{buildroot}%{_libdir}/llvm-pgo-profdata/%{name}/%{name}.llvm.profdata \\\
  " : "%{nil}" ]
----

The bigger a package gets, the more problematic disk space is going to
be. For example, when compiling the `chromium` project with an
instrumented LLVM toolchain, I ran into these error messages after 1
hour:

____
`LLVM Profile Error: Failed to write file "/builddir/build/BUILD/raw-pgo-profdata//chromium.llvm.1970228969820616430_0.24617.profraw": No space left on device`
____

As a consequence, we cannot let the build process continue to run until
it is done (until the end of the `%build` section) only to then pick up
the pieces and merge the raw profiles. We have to do this continuously
in order to avoid disk space issues.

To imporove this situation, we’re starting a background merge script
right before we enter the `%build` section:

*macros.llvm-pgo-instrumentation-setup*

[source,spec]
----
%__llvm_pgo_instrumented_spec_build_pre \
    [ 0%{__llvm_pgo_subpackage} > 0 ] \\\
    && %{__pgo_env} \\\
    && /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/pgo-background-merge.sh \\\
      -d %{__pgo_profdir} \\\
      -f %{__pgo_background_merge_target} \\\
      -p %{__pgo_pid_file} & \
----

In order to stop the background job before it gets killed by the
`__spec_build_post` macro, we’ve got this macro:

*macros.llvm-pgo-instrumentation-setup*

[source,spec]
----
%__llvm_pgo_instrumented_spec_build_post \
  if [ 0%{__llvm_pgo_subpackage} > 0 ]\
  then\
      echo 'please exit' > %{__pgo_shutdown_file};\
      [ -e %{__pgo_pid_file} ] && inotifywait -e delete_self %{__pgo_pid_file} || true;\
  fi\
----

We ask the background job to gracefully shut down by writing to a
*shutdown file*. Then we wait using `inotifywait` until the background
job’s PID (process ID) file is deleted.

The

[source,spec]
----
%__llvm_pgo_instrumented_spec_build_post
----

macro is used in the override of

[source,spec]
----
%__spec_build_post
----

which among other situations is called at the end of each `%build`
macro:

*pgo-regen-macros.sh*

[source,spec]
----
# Overriding __spec_build_post macro from /usr/lib/rpm/macros
%__spec_build_post \
  %{?__llvm_pgo_instrumented_spec_build_post} \
  %{___build_post}
----

[[merge_for_smaller_profiles]]
[IMPORTANT]
====
But why not store the raw profiles? In the first incarnation of this
experiment I did store the raw profiles and I noticed that the final
`myapp-llvm-pgo-profdata` RPM was 128MB in size. When we first merge the
profiles we get it down to ~900KB. I did a similar experiment for the
`retsnoop` project and there the effect was also very big: ~1,4GB for
raw profile data down to ~1,6MB for merged one.
====

[TIP]
====
You can call `llvm-profdata merge` on already merged profiles.
====

[[_pgo_background_merge]]
==== PGO background merge

The background script itself waits for `close_write` events on
`*.profraw` files in a directory to be observed. It writes the filenames
into a batch file:

*step0/llvm/pgo-background-merge.sh*

[source,spec]
----
    # On every *.profraw file written to in the directory <observe_dir>,
    # add the file name to list of files to process in a batch.
    inotifywait -q -m -o $batch_file -e close_write \
        --format '%f' \
        --include $files_regex \
        $observe_dir > /dev/null 2>&1 &
----

Once the batch size reaches the minimum size, we merge the profiles in
the batch file and delete them when we’re done. This saves disk space
when building large projects.

*step0/llvm/pgo-background-merge.sh*

[source,spec]
----
    llvm-profdata merge \
        --compress-all-sections \
        --sparse \
        `[ -e $target_merge_file ] && echo "$target_merge_file"` \
        $(cat $batch_file_in_process) \
        -o $target_merge_file
    # IMPORTANT: Free up disk space!
    rm -fv $(cat $batch_file_in_process)
----

Now, for the simple application in this experiment it might look like
overkill, but trust me, we need this for building bigger projects like
`chromium`.

[[_how_to_toggle_off_pgo_profile_package_generation]]
=== How to toggle off PGO profile package generation?

When installing the PGO instrumented LLVM we can still turn off the
generation of profile files by putting
`%global __llvm_pgo_subpackage %{nil}` in the spec file (e.g. in
`myapp.spec`).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently there’s no sanity checking of whether or not a package can
even produce PGO profiles. If there’s no compiler or the compiler is not
clang, my patch doesn’t work. But right now we don’t care so much about
this and consider it an optimization for later. I just wanted to let you
know.
====

[[_do_you_pgo_for_cross_compilation]]
=== Do you PGO for cross-compilation?

No. By default we optimize for each individual architecture. We think
that this is good for now. The cases in which you want to cross-compile
on one architecture for another exists but are not considered here (for
now).

[[_conclusion]]
== Conclusion

We’ve seen how we can gather PGO profile data from building unmodified
RPM packages and feed this data into a PGO-optimized recompilation of
LLVM.

The most tricky part for me was the background merge script. Building an
instrumented and optimized step was the most straight-forward part.

I hope you liked this article and follow us exploring the possibilities
ahead of us! Don’t forget to leave a comment ;)
